# AIGS_GREENSKILLS

**Green Skills and AI Learning Journey
Overview**
This repository documents my exploration of AI and Machine Learning (ML) through a sustainability-focused lens. The Green Skills and AI course provided hands-on experience with data-driven decision-making, resource-efficient algorithms, and ethical AI practices.

**Key Learning Areas**

**Sustainable AI Development**
Supervised Learning: Applied regression and classification models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) for efficient predictions.
Unsupervised Learning: Explored clustering (K-Means) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for optimized data usage.

**Practical Applications**
Implemented ML techniques to analyze real-world datasets for resource conservation and efficient data processing.
Engaged in quizzes and projects reinforcing AIâ€™s role in sustainable innovation.
Version Control & Collaboration
Mastered GitHub for efficient code management and collaborative workflows, ensuring reusable and transparent AI solutions.

**Future Focus**
Advancing skills in deep learning for climate modeling and smart resource management.
Contributing to open-source AI projects that align with sustainable development goals (SDGs).
